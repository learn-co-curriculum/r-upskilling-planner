## Persona for Lessons

Jordan has just graduated from the Flatiron School data science bootcamp.
They are currently applying for their first job in data science.

They have a foundational understanding of questions that might be asked of a junior data scientist and can speak comfortably about basics of Python as a programming language and have completed an entire portfolio project end-to-end using Python. 

Jordan is getting a bit discouraged on the job hunt having to now be in what feels like a saturated job market with no "real" data science experience which is leading to feeling disappointed. 
They want to feel comfortable putting R on their resume and talk about the basics of R in an interview so they can demonstrate their versatility as a data scientist. 

Jordan is not able to work on an online IDE and to learn R must get it on their machine.


## R to Python: An Overview

Learning Objectives:

* [X] Explain why a data scientist might want to know both R and Python 
* [X] List common misconceptions about all things R vs Python
* [X] Identify parallel packages in a data scientist's workflow between R and Python
* [X] List major syntax similarities and differences between R and Python  

## Installing R 

* [X] Have base R installed on a computer
* [X] Have Rstudio installed on their computer
* [X] Install the tidyverse 
* [X] Run commands in editor, notice that it shows in global environment 
* [X] Execute tips script using library 
* [X] Examine tips output in console 
* [X] Change color of RStudio 
* [X] Get R Markdown to work 

## Basic Syntax: Part 1 

* [ ] Get prepared to be a bit annoyed (beyond 0 indexing) 
* [ ] Simlarities in data types in R and Python
* [ ] Explain vectorization in R 
* [ ] Explain square bracket operator in R 
* [ ] Accessing parts of vector
* [ ] Vectors as a part of a dataframe 
* [ ] Lists in R 

## Basic Syntax: Part 2

* [ ] Writing Functions in R 
* [ ] Avoiding for loops 

## R: Tidyverse 

* [ ] Name major packages in tidyverse and what they are meant to do 
* [ ] Go over five basic verbs in dplyr 
* [ ] Find analysis in on data cleaning from learn.co that can mirror 

## R Libraries: ggplot2

* [ ] Reproduce plots 

## R Libraries: ggplot2 lab

* [ ] Create


## TidyModel 

* [ ] Very recently launched version of tidymodels 
* [ ] Used to be "caret" but tidymodels is way to go
* [ ] Walk through analysis of housing dataset from before with sci-kit 

## TidyModels: Lab 

* [ ] Design own lab !
